## Introduction

IoTivity is an open source framework that implements the [Open Connectivity Foundation](http://www.openconnectivity.org/) (OCF) standards providing easy and secure communications for IoT devices.

Each day more and more devices are coming online, adding to the ever-growing Internet of Things (IoT). Analysts agree that the IoT will grow to many billions of devices over the next decade.

The challenge for the IoT ecosystem is to ensure that these emerging IoT devices can connect securely and reliably to the Internet and to each other.

The IoTivity project was created to bring together the open-source community to accelerate the development of the framework and services required to connect these billions of devices.

The IoTivity project is sponsored by the Open Connectivity Foundation (OCF), a group of industry leaders that have created a standard specification and certification program to address these challenges.

The IoTivity project delivers a reference implementation of the [OCF standard specifications](https://openconnectivity.org/developer/specifications/). 
The OCF specifications are [ISO/IEC](https://www.iso.org/standard/53238.html) recognized international standards.
