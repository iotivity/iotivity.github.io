If you're having issues getting started with IoTivity, these common questions and answers should help.

### I'm having issues with curl

* The IoTivity installer script can be found here.
* The OTGC installer script can be found here.
* Both scripts can be copied to a local .sh file and executed if the curl command is failing.
* Run all scripts as superuser.

### I'm building on Windows

* Check the "Building sample applications on Windows" section of the "IoTivity-lite" github folder.

### I'm not building on Windows or Ubuntu Linux 18, and have generic toolchain issues

* Try installing Ubuntu Linux 18 or creating an Ubuntu 18 VM using VMWare Workstation (free download for non-commercial use).

### Is there an Android client?

* Yes! The Android version of the OTGC can be installed following these directions.

### Is there an Windows client?

* Yes! Device Spy runs on windows and can be installed following these directions.

* Device Spy is an Onboarding Tool and generic Client, and interacts with devices on JSON level.

Still no luck?
